#  Stress Detection using Bernoulli Naive Bayes

This project is a simple machine learning model that predicts whether a person is stressed or not. Iâ€™ve used the **Bernoulli Naive Bayes algorithm**, which works well for binary classification problems.

---

##  What I Did

- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset
- Used `BernoulliNB` from scikit-learn to train the model
- Achieved an accuracy of **74.88%**
- Plotted basic visualizations using Matplotlib to understand the data better



##  Model Details

- **Algorithm used**: Bernoulli Naive Bayes  
- **Accuracy**: `0.7488` (74.88%)  
- No confusion matrix or precision/recall metrics used (kept it simple for now)

---

##  Libraries Used are 

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Google Colab (for development)


## ðŸš€ Future Improvements

- Add confusion matrix, classification report
- Try out other algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Improve accuracy through feature engineering or hyperparameter tuning
